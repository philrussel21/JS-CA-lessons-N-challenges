Using your growing knowledge of:

1. identifying node/document elements
2. event listeners
3. amending CSS styles

you are going to create a mini game where you move MewMew across the screen.

_You shouldnt have to update any of the existing CSS (but feel free to if you would like to)_

To help with updating MewMew's location, refer to the docs on [parseInt](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parseInt.asp)

(Docs on events)[https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp]

**For a further challenge.**

Add further events that allow you to press keyboard keys instead of or in addition to the buttons

i.e. Left Arrow to move Left
